scripts + workflows used in smooth muscle cell study
This Repo contains scripts from different analyses used during a study on coronary artery disease in reference to genome wide association studies (GWAS) and the molecular mechanisms underlying inflammation in smooth muscle cells. Some approaches were general differential expression (DE), allele specific expression (ASE), and functional gene enrichment (func-enrich).
